# Week1_Assignment # Week 1 Data Science Assignment

## Description
This repository contains the Week 1 Data Science assignment. 
The task was to perform basic data analysis on a student marks dataset using Python.

## Contents
- `StudentMarks.csv` : The dataset containing marks of students in multiple subjects.
- `week1_DataScience` : Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook with Python code for data analysis, 
  including descriptive statistics, visualizations (histograms and boxplots), 
  and interpretation of insights.

## Objective
- Load dataset using Pandas.
- Calculate descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
- Visualize data distributions using Matplotlib.
- Write a short interpretation of insights (score spread, outliers).
- Summarize findings.

## Insights & Summary
- Most students scored in the mid-to-high range.
- Score distributions are fairly balanced across subjects.
- No extreme outliers are observed; some subjects show slightly higher variability.
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations help understand student performance and trends.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
