This assignment focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student marks dataset using the Python data science stack.
Using Pandas, I loaded and processed the data to calculate descriptive statistics, revealing a mean Maths score of 80.6 and a median of 81.
This close alignment between mean and median indicates a generally symmetrical distribution of data points.
To measure the spread of performance, I calculated the standard deviation, which quantifies how much the students' scores deviate from the class average.

The core of the analysis involved data visualization using Matplotlib to create a frequency distribution histogram.
The "Frequency" or "Number of Students" on the Y-axis represents the student count, which visually highlights a bimodal distribution with peaks at the 75 and 85-mark intervals. 
This visualization was instrumental in identifying a lower-end outlier (score of 66), representing a performance gap that summary statistics alone might overlook. 
This project demonstrates proficiency in transforming raw data into actionable academic insights through programmatic analysis.
By combining statistical rigor with visual storytelling, the final output provides a clear overview of class competency and identifies areas for potential educational intervention.

Technical Workflow Highlights

Libraries: pandas for data structures, matplotlib.pyplot for visualization.

Statistical Metrics: Mean, Median, Mode, and Standard Deviation.

Key Findings: Identification of two high-frequency clusters and one significant outlier.

Deliverables: Cleanly documented Jupyter Notebook with integrated plots and data interpretations.
